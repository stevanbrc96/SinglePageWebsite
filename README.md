Getting Started
To view and run this website locally:

Save the Code: Copy the entire HTML code provided in the Canvas document.

Create index.html: Paste the copied code into a new file named index.html.

Open in Browser: Open the index.html file with your preferred web browser.

Customization
Recipe Images: Replace the https://placehold.co/... image URLs in the recipe cards with your actual images of the drinks to enhance visual appeal.

Add More Recipes: You can easily add more <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg shadow-md ..."> blocks within the "Our Featured Recipes" section to expand your recipe collection.

Backend Integration: For persistent storage of submitted recipes, you would need to integrate a backend server (e.g., Node.js, Python/Flask, etc.) and a database (e.g., Firebase Firestore, MongoDB, PostgreSQL). The proveriFormu() JavaScript function would then be extended to make an API call to your backend to save the data.
